# Decentralized-App
The purpose of this project is to create a wallet through a smart contract that operates within the local blockchain using Ganache and Truffle. 
This wallet is supposed to transfer fake Ether. Moreover, this wallet is supposed to interact with the Frontend that was built prior to the smart contract using React Js.
React appears to be more complicated than that. Therefore, more time must be dedicated to it through projects and books to grasp the philosophy behind it.
